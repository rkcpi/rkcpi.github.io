								<p>"I had the good fortune to work with Sandra at BRYTER. Even though we were on different teams, our paths would often cross, as Sandra would typically work on cross-functional topics.</p>
								<p>After joining BRYTER, Sandra dived deep into the authentication and authorization system. She was incredibly quick in building up knowledge and made sure we would benefit from more self-service features, be ready for scaling up and keep up with the frequent security releases. When Sandra rotated into the internal developer experience team, her passion for developer experience topics became apparent. She could play out her strength in Java, Kotlin, Spring Framework, Testing, Operations, Build Tools, Continuous Integration and Continues Delivery techniques, and made a lasting impact. For example, her continuous contributions to cross-team programming sessions and her work in speeding up build pipelines, have made a positive impact on developer productivity.</p>
								<p>In my experience, Sandra would not actively seek the limelight, but her actions speak louder then words. I was always impressed by Sandra’s willingness to step-up and take on difficult topics, her ability to find the most fitting solution, but most importantly doing so in close collaboration with stakeholders and peers. Her supportive nature and focus on tangible results consistently shine through. And with her vast experience in working remotely, Sandra has shown how effective and connected a team member can be, regardless of location.</p>
								<p>Since her time at BRYTER, Sandra has ventured into the world of freelance software engineering. It's clear to me that her journey is one of continuous growth and adaptability, especially in her pursuit of enhancing developer experiences in teams everywhere. For anyone in need of a skilled and dedicated software engineer with a deep understanding of the nuances of developer experience, ready to get her hands dirty, I recommend starting a conversation with Sandra!"</p>

								<p>"Already when getting to know Sandra during the recruiting phase at BRYTER, I was impressed with her deep knowledge and a seeming ease with which she could explain complex technical topics.</p>
								<p>Then having Sandra on the team, proved to be an awesome luck, as she showed a very high level of pro-activeness, immediately took ownership of a critical subsystem and made it so much better. All with minimal supervision and support.</p>
								<p>When that system was under control, Sandra didn't stop and stagnate, but rather switched gears and became a major contributor to pushing Continuous Deployment and Delivery at BRYTER, all while increasing the overall developer experience for every Engineer across all teams.</p>
								<p>I'd love to have the chance to work with Sandra again and any can count themselves lucky.</p>
